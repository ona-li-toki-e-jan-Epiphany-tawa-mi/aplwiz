# units

This project contains a collection of unit testing templates I've written to
quickly add unit testing to your projects.

Currently, there only exists a for GNU APL projects, but I will add scripts for
more languages as I come to need them.

The scripts *are* templates, so they will require modification to work with your
project. Check the files for instructions.

## unit.apl

For GNU APL
[https://www.gnu.org/software/apl](https://www.gnu.org/software/apl)
projects.

No extra dependencies.

To run the example tests, run one of the following commands:

```sh
apl --script units.apl
./units.apl
```
